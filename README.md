# ArduinoWaterHeaterIOT
IoT Probe of a solar PV water heating system - Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Python, MQTT, MySQL

The Arduino sends the AC and DC watts consumed by a heating element, as well as the temperature of the water, to a Linux machine running the MQTT code via GSM. The Arduino also sends to a Raspberry Pi, via USB, connected to a display for real time display and efficiency tracking metrics on the display.
